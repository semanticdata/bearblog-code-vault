# 🐻 Bearblog Code Vault 🐼

This repo contains placeholder HTML from my [bearblog](https://miguelpimentel.do/) mixed with current CSS, and JavaScript code being used on the site.

It allows me to test new things without accidentally breaking the site. 😅

This branch is deployed using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org).
