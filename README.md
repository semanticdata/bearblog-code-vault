# 🐻 Bearblog Code Vault

This repository contains placeholder HTML (from my [bearblog](https://miguelpimentel.do/)) mixed with CSS, and JavaScript code being used on the site. It allows for testing new things without fear of accidentally breaking the site. 😅

We use [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) to make working on it easier. The output within the `build` directory is then used to style the canonical blog.
