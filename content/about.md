# About me

Hello, my name is Miguel Pimentel. I am a self-taught hobby developer with too many ideas and not enough time. I was born in the Dominican Republic, and currently live in Minnesota, US.

I think a lot, work a lot, have existential crises, and know just enough about making websites to make me dangerous. I enjoy writing, reading, coding, listening to music, and love having a problem to solve.

A chronic case of curiosity leads me to learn and do many interesting things. For example:

- … designing bike trails and residential roads in AutoCAD Civil 3D.
- … creating my own [browser extensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/17772574/).
- … teaching [ESL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_as_a_second_or_foreign_language).
- … learning web development and computer programming.
- … getting licensed as a Firefighter.
- … getting certified as Emergency Medical Technician.
- … inspecting public road construction projects.
- … working in a construction materials laboratory.

In my spare time, I'm drawn to a diverse range of interests, including web development, public infrastructure, fire science, digital gardening, materials science, game development, and personal knowledge management.

## Work Experience

As an Assistant Contract Administrator for [Metro Transit](https://www.metrotransit.org/), I oversee projects through their installation, construction, and commissioning phases. On a day-to-day basis, I manage multiple projects that tie in one way or another to the public transportation system of the Twin Cities' metro area in Minnesota.

With over 10 years of experience in public construction, I have amassed a number of unique projects and experiences that cover many different fields. It all started when I got my first job as a Civil Engineering Technician for a contracting company near my university. I was at the time attending [INTEC](https://www.intec.edu.do/) while pursuing a Bachelor's in Civil Engineering. Unfortunately, I was unable to finish my college education due to personal problems.

Nevertheless, today I thrive having experience in not only public infrastructure, but technology, electrical, rail, and bus related projects as well. If interested, here's my [resume](https://api.raindrop.io/v2/raindrop/779238867/file?type=application/pdf).
